## Description
- Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. So I created an app that can allow user to view and controll data base of employees of the business they own
- I also build this app to improve my skills with SQL type database
-  
- I learned how to create connection between user interface and database
